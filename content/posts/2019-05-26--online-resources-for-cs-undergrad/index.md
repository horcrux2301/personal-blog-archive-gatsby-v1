YouTube channels that I follow which post quality content related to Computer Science - 

1. [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) - Videos related to maths and computer science with beautiful animations. Want to learn what blockchain is? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).
2. [Algorithms Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBLr7ISa_YDy5qeATupf26w) - His one hour videos on concepts related to algorithms and data structures are very good. He covers topics which are generally harder to grasp. Want to learn binary lifting technique to find Lowest Common Ancestor in a tree? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOfa6t8WnbI).
3. [Codechef](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmk2YHXZQk_3GsLKBqsZoBQ) - Codechef's youtube channel has videos from programming camps that they have held in previous years. Indian Competitive Programmers like Tanuj Khattar and Akashdeep Nain attend these as coaches and you can find their lectures here.
4. [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw) - This channel has tutorials on probably every commonly used language there is. Have an interview tomorrow and want to brush up your SQL skills in an hour? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPu6qV5byu4)
5. [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw) - Software Engineer at Uber. Videos related to concept in algorithms and data structures. For some time he has been making videos on System Design which is a topic on which such consolidated resources are scarce. 
6. [Tech Lead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw) - If you don't know the tech lead. Do you even write code? Ex Google Tech Lead with videos from life in silicon valley to advice on how to manage your money to resources on algorithms and data structures he uploads videos on everything.
7. [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) - A good place to checkout if you want to be up-to date with AI and ML stuff. Want to get started with AI and ML. Checkout his 3 month curriculum - [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr6VqTRO1v0&t=507s) and [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months)

11. [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) - Great channel especially for beginners. Uses Javascript as the main language to develop applications. His videos are high on energy. So you won't feel bored while learning concepts and developing cool things.
12. [Tushar Roy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLJf_R2sWyUtXSKiKlyvAw) - Videos on most used algorithms and data structures with well thought out examples and explanations. The only problem that I have with his content is that he gives no intuition on the algorithm and jumps straight into the material.
13. [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoebwHSTvwalADTJhps0emA) - Javascript and related content.
14. [CommaAi Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwgKmJM4ZJQRJ-U5NjvR2dg) - Twitch streams by George Hotz can be found here. You can see him coding projects live from scratch. Personal fan of his work ethic evident from such stream.
15. [Joma Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0qA-eDDICsRR9rPcnG7tw) - Ex Data Scientist at Facebook. Videos on life in Silicon Valley among some resource related ones.
